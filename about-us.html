	<h1>Learn more about Women in Politics</h1>
</head>

<body>
<p>By educating young women and girls about the importance of politics, and imbuing them with the skills they need to be leaders, you can give women the running start they need to achieve greater political power. With an earlier start in politics, women will climb higher on the leadership ladder, allowing more women to share in the decision making power of this country.</p>
