<h2>Hillary Clinton</h2>
<div id="Clinton"><img src="Hillary Clinton.jpg" alt="Hillary-Clinton"></div>
<p>The former First Lady, former Secretary of State and former presidential hopeful has a long history of touching on the power of women. 
<div class="subparagraph">
In 1995, at the UN's Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, Clinton said "Human rights are women's rights. And women's rights are human rights."
</div>

<div>
Fast forward a few decades to 2013 and Clinton is still fighting for women!
</div>

<div class="subparagraph">
<p>"By helping women in some of the most dire circumstances…you are not only helping them, you're helping communities and countries — helping make our world more prosperous, more peaceful."</p>
</div>
<h2>Michelle Obama</h2>
 <div id="Obama"><img src="Michelle Obama.jpg" alt="Michelle-Obama"></div>

<div> <p>Obama knows the truth: Women are just smarter. </div>

<div class="subparagraph">When asked in 2014 why it's important to speak up as First Lady, she simply responded "Women are smarter than men," according to CNN. </div>

<div><p>And she isn't shy about taking men to task for not realizing it. In July 2014, Obama argued that true progress can't be made until men "look into their hearts and souls and ask if they truly view women as their equals," according to Elle. </p> </div>

<h4> About the website: http://www.cawp.rutgers.edu/ </h4>

<p class="subparagraph"> This website has a lot of interesting features. It is good looking and has a lot of information. I am interested in the "mobile" and "device" codes as they seem to imply some sort of mobile device feature. There are large blocks of text with lots of @ symbols and colons that I cannot seem to identify. There are also lots of divider elements and I would like to learn more about the proper ways to use them. You can find the Center for American Women and Politics Website <a href="http://www.cawp.rutgers.edu/"> here. </a> </p>
